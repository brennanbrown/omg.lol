Based on the Brutalist Web Design guidelines, here are the key principles for making a static blog:

## Core Philosophy

**Prioritize content and visitors above all else.** A website exists to deliver content, not to imitate applications, magazines, or databases. Design should serve this purpose honestly and transparently.

## Content & Readability

**Make content readable everywhere.** Default HTML without custom styling is already readable on all devices. Design should enhance readability, never diminish it. Text must work on large screens, small screens, and screen readers.

**Enable scrolling as the primary navigation.** Don't artificially paginate content to inflate engagement metrics. Let visitors consume content at their own pace using their preferred scrolling method.

## Interaction Design

**Only links and buttons should be clickable.** Websites are hypertext documents with two core interactions: navigating to more information (links) and submitting data (buttons). Don't make other elements clickable—it confuses and deceives visitors.

**Make links and buttons obvious.** Underline hyperlinks—it's the web's universal convention. Style buttons to look pressable and distinct from links. Stay close to native form elements that visitors already understand from their operating system.

**Never break the back button.** It's the user's undo mechanism. Breaking it shows contempt for visitors.

## Visual Design

**Start simple, add styling only to solve problems.** Begin with left-aligned black text on white background. Apply decoration only when needed, never for vanity. Decoration should support content consumption, not distract from it.

**Understand semantic HTML.** Use elements for their intended purpose. This creates honest, accessible websites.

**Design for small screens first.** This forces focus on essential content.

## Performance & Honesty

**Speed is a feature.** By following these guidelines naturally, your site will load fast. Respect visitors' time, bandwidth, and battery.

**No unrelated content or tricks.** Avoid misleading links, sensationalist headlines, or distracting images. Don't trick visitors into clicking ads. Focus on compelling content instead.

## Guiding Principle

**Fight for the users.** When uncertain about a design choice, prioritize what serves your visitors best.
