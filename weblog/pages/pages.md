# slash pages 

_A guide to common pages you can add to your website_ 

Slash pages are common pages you can add to your website, usually with a standard, root-level slug like `/now`, `/about`, or `/uses`. They tend to describe the individual behind the site and are distinguishing characteristics of the IndieWeb. 

The name was coined independently by both [Caleb Hearth](https://calebhearth.com/) and [Shellsharks](https://shellsharks.com/). This page was made by [Robb Knight](https://rknight.me/).
